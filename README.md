# Atlas X
 A C89 game engine making use of my supporting libraries of C89 tools. Atlas X is providing the main direction in developing the C Utils libraries.

## Abstract
 Atlas X started as a successor to my Atlas project. I made Atlas as a brute force exercise in testing and displaying what I was capable of doing with my C++ knowledge during my 3rd year of university. Atlas X on the other hand is an exercise in expanding my fundamental knowledge of lower level programming, memory management and development without convinient tools. Atlas X is likely not an example of what I as a developer should do on a full production project, but what I think as a developer I should learn and know intimately.
 
 What I hope to achieve is a performant and stable engine that is convinient to develop with but limited in scope. As of writing I started Atlas X and C Utils 2 years ago, and the knowledge gained at the time helped my understanding of debugging and memory management immensely, changing how I view memory and the late stage standard libraries. As I develop now in 2023 I see how far I've come and believe there is still more to be learned in designing of coding standard, convinience of reading, debugging tools and I expect when it is more feature complete, profiling.
 
 ## More?
  I would advise looking to the [C Utils Readme](https://github.com/thebombshell/c_utils) for my early thoughts on intent and coding standards within C Utils and by extension Atlas X, I am already thinking I need to update this standard and partake in some refactoring to take into account things like pointer ownership, typedef use with pointers, intent types and expectations from functions regarding pointers.
